<div class="blogheader"><h3>How did you implements comments to blog posts?</h3></div>

<p>To implement comments for my blog posts I have used Disqus. Disqus is a free, straightforward and global
comment system which is very easy to implement with Jekyll which this site is run on. First you sign
up for a Discqus account <a href="https://disqus.com/">here</a> and then you register your Jekyll website. I basically
just followed <a href="https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/">this</a> guide. If I want to disable comments I just put "comments: false" in that
posts YAML front-matter. Easy like a sunday morning.</p>
