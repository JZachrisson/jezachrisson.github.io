How did you implements comments to blog posts?

To implement comments for my blog posts I have used Disqus. Disqus is a free, straightforward, global
comment system that is easy to implement with Jekyll which this site is run on. First you sign
up for a Discqus account here and then you register your Jekyll website. I basically
just followed this guide. If I want to disable comments I just put "comments: false" in that
posts YAML front-matter. Easy like a sunday morning.
