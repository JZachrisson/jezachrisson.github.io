<div class="blogheader"><h3>What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h3></div>

<p>Humans.txt is a text file that is used to present the people and authors behind a website. 
It gives information about the persons who's contributed to building the website.
Instead of having the authors sign the website, you add this humans.txt file to prove
authorship in an external, easy and accessible way. You can read more here. For my site I have used 
bits of what seems to be the standard template, where I give information about the site, 
authorship and give thanks/acknowledgements to people involved in making this website happen.</p>
