<h3>What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h3>

<p>Humans.txt is a text file that is used to present the people and authors behind a website. 
It gives information about the persons who have contributed to building the website.
Instead of having the authors sign the website, you add this .txt file to prove
authorship in an external, easy and accessible way. Read more here.

For my site I have used bits of what seems to be the standard template, where
I give information about the site, authorship and thanks/acknowledgements.</p>
