<div class="blogheader"><h3>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h3></div>

<p>Open Graph is a technology that allows integration between social media and a website. By integrating Open Graph 
meta tags into your page's content, you can tell for example
Facebook what information to be used to represent your page in the preview 
when you share it. You can identify which elements, images etc, of your page you want 
to show when someone share's your page. To implement Open Graph, you put the meta tags in your header
and then for each page that needs Open Graph you define the Jekyll variables in the YAML front matter. Read more
