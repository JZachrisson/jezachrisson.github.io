<div class="blogheader"><h3>What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS? Compare to regular CSS.</h3></div>

<p>For this website project, all CSS should be generated from a CSS preprocessor. In my case I have used Sass.
Since my career in web development has been quite short I have not even used regular CSS that much yet to be honest.
So it is not with the greatest of authorithy that I can compare the use of regular CSS with that of a preprocessor. But I shall do my 
best and share my thoughts on what the experience has been so far. 

<p>Learning and using regular CSS has been fun and challenging. What I noticed early on is that very quickly you get a lot of code.
And a lot of code to keep track on. And in my case, a lot of messy, repetetive and the general feel of a lack of structure in the code. 
All in all it feels that there must be a way to make it smoother, more ordered and efficient.</p>

<p>In comes Sass. With Sass you are now introduced to a wider range of functionality with the use of variables, nesting, mixins, functions
and probably a lot more cool stuff that I'm not aware of yet. With variables you can you can hold font-styles and colors which makes
it much more efficient when it comes to making changes in the code. You can break up your styles into multiple styles and organize
them in a structured way. Researching Sass, I've found that one popular way is called the 7-1 Architecture. You can read more about it here.
This is definitely something I aim to use for my projects since it seems like a good practice. For now I've started a bit to use variables
for my colors and nesting to the extent which seems possible and practical. I'm looking forward to dive deeper into Sass and will
keep updating this blog post as I start to use more of its functionalities. So far I see a lot of pros and have not figured out
any real con yet. What I've heard about it is that there could be a problem with code line-numbers when debugging your code
as they are not the same as within the source code. I guess I will experience that soon.</p>
