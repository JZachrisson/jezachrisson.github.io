What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

The robots.txt file is a simple text file that you place on your web server which controls
how search enginge spiders can access and interact with your webpages. In the 
robot.txt file you give instructions to the search engine spider and tell it if it has permission to
access a page or a file. Reasons for wanting to have a robots.txt file
could be for example that you have content you want blocked from search engines
or you need to give certain special instructions regarding paid links or advertisements.
This information I have learnt from here, where you can read more.

For myself I have configured my robots.txt file to give access and permission to index all parts of my site.
This is mostly because I feel I have yet to understand and appreciate what I could possibly want to 
deny access to on this website so far.
