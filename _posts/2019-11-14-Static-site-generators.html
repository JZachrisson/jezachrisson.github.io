<h3>What do you think of static site generators? What type of projects are they suitable for?</h3>

<p>Again, I feel like I'm repeating myself, but I'm very new to web development, creating websites and all that it involves.
Therefor I'm completely new to static site generators (what a surprise, huh?). What I've gotten from it so far is
that it seems to be a pretty easy to grasp and fast way of creating and deploying a website. You can simplify your
code and avoid repetition by using markdown which Jekyll then spits out as html.

It seems to suit very well for an everyday website with a blog where you don't need access to a database and it is
very easy to add comment plugins from third parties. I guess I'll learn more along the way. Until then you
can read more <a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/why-use-a-static-site-generator/?fbclid=IwAR0PgCliWQr30_kdQIguaxsC92pmpgRL9DS2KPuK54wdVtfU_BNP1z7UCRQ">here.</a></p>
